# Learning Material: Creating a Result Report for Functional Tests Based on Test Cases

Functional testing ensures that software functionalities work as expected according to specified requirements. A **Result Report** communicates the outcomes of these tests, providing insights into software quality.

---

## Objectives
By the end of this guide, you will be able to:
1. Understand the structure of a functional test result report.
2. Use test cases to document results.
3. Generate actionable insights from the report.

---

## Key Components of a Functional Test Result Report
1. **Title and Metadata**
   - **Title**: Clearly identify the project and test phase (e.g., "Functional Test Results for Release 1.2.0").
   - **Date**: The date the report was created.
   - **Tester Name(s)**: The individual(s) who conducted the tests.
   - **Version Information**: Software version and test environment details.

2. **Executive Summary**
   - Brief overview of:
     - Total test cases.
     - Passed, failed, or skipped tests.
     - Major issues identified.
   - Purpose: Summarize test coverage and findings for stakeholders.

3. **Test Case Results**
   - A detailed section where each test case and its outcome is documented.

4. **Defect Details**
   - Description of bugs, errors, or failures encountered during the test.

5. **Conclusions and Recommendations**
   - A summary of findings and actionable recommendations for developers or product managers.

## Steps to Create the Result Report

### 1. Prepare the Test Case Results
Each test case should include:
   - **Test Case ID**: Unique identifier for the test case.
   - **Description**: Brief description of the functionality being tested.
   - **Preconditions**: Setup required before executing the test.
   - **Test Steps**: Steps to execute the test.
   - **Expected Result**: The anticipated behavior of the system.
   - **Actual Result**: What actually happened during testing.
   - **Status**: Outcome of the test (e.g., "Pass", "Fail", "Blocked").
   - **Comments/Notes**: Details about failures, observations, or anomalies.

### 2. Format the Report
Structure the report using tables and sections for clarity. Example:

| **Test Case ID** | **Description**           | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result** | **Status** | **Comments**              |
|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| TC-01            | Login Functionality       | User logs in         | User logs in      | Pass       |                           |
| TC-02            | Password Reset Function   | Reset email sent     | Email not sent    | Fail       | SMTP error observed       |

### 3. Capture and Describe Defects
Include defect logs with the following details:
   - **Defect ID**: Unique identifier.
   - **Description**: Clear and concise explanation of the defect.
   - **Severity**: High, Medium, Low.
   - **Steps to Reproduce**: How to recreate the issue.
   - **Expected vs. Actual Behavior**: Comparison to highlight the issue.
   - **Attachments**: Screenshots, logs, or videos if available.

| **Defect ID** | **Description**              | **Severity** | **Steps to Reproduce**             | **Expected Behavior**    | **Actual Behavior**  |
|---------------|------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| DEF-001       | Password reset email failure | High         | 1. Navigate to "Forgot Password".  | Email sent successfully. | No email received.  |

### 4. Generate Metrics
Present overall testing statistics:
   - Total test cases: X
   - Passed: Y
   - Failed: Z
   - Blocked: W
   - Pass Rate: `(Passed / Total) * 100%`

### 5. Write Conclusions
   - Summarize the overall performance of the application.
   - List key risks or issues that must be addressed.
   - Recommend next steps (e.g., re-test specific modules, prioritize bug fixes).
