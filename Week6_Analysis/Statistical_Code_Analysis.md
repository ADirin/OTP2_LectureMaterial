---

## Limitations of FindBugs

- FindBugs analyzes bytecode, so certain issues detectable only in source code might be missed.
- It doesnâ€™t actively support modern Java language features (Java 9+).

For a more modern alternative, consider using **SpotBugs**, which is actively maintained and provides updated rules.



### Example

- Create a java class and follow the instructions for testing

```java
public class Example {

    private static String message;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to FindBugs Example!");

        // Potential bug: NullPointerException risk
        System.out.println(message.toLowerCase());

        // Potential bug: Unused variable
        int unusedVariable = 42;
    }
}


```
