## Key Metrics in Statistical Code Analysis

1. **Lines of Code (LOC)**
   - **Definition**: Total number of lines in the codebase.
   - **Purpose**: A basic measure of the code size and complexity.

2. **Cyclomatic Complexity**
   - **Definition**: A metric that measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code.
   - **Purpose**: Indicates the complexity of a program and helps identify areas that may be difficult to maintain.

3. **Code Churn**
   - **Definition**: The percentage of code added, modified, or deleted over a specific period.
   - **Purpose**: A measure of code stability and indicates potential volatility.

4. **Comment Density**
   - **Definition**: The ratio of comment lines to the total lines of code.
   - **Purpose**: Assesses code documentation quality and maintainability.

5. **Duplication Ratio**
   - **Definition**: The percentage of code that is duplicated within the codebase.
   - **Purpose**: Identifies code smells and areas where refactoring is needed.

6. **Test Coverage**
   - **Definition**: The percentage of code that is tested by automated tests.
   - **Purpose**: Indicates the effectiveness of tests and the likelihood of undetected bugs.

## Challenges in Statistical Code Analysis

- **False Positives**: Tools may flag non-issues, leading to wasted time addressing irrelevant warnings.
- **Integration Complexity**: Integrating analysis tools into existing workflows can be challenging.
- **Metric Interpretation**: Misinterpretation of metrics can lead to incorrect conclusions about code quality.
- **Resistance to Change**: Developers may resist adopting new practices and tools due to existing workflows.

# **Student Guide: Setting Up and Using Checkstyle in IntelliJ**

This guide will help you set up and use Checkstyle in IntelliJ IDEA to ensure your code adheres to consistent coding standards.

---

## **1. Install Checkstyle Plugin**
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Go to `File > Settings` (or `Preferences` on macOS).
3. Navigate to `Plugins`.
4. Search for **Checkstyle** in the plugin marketplace.
5. Click `Install` and restart IntelliJ IDEA if prompted.

---

## **2. Configure Checkstyle**
1. Go to `File > Settings > Tools > Checkstyle`.
2. Click the **+** icon to add a new configuration.
3. Choose `Use a local Checkstyle file` and browse to locate your `checkstyle.xml` file.
   - You can download a sample `checkstyle.xml` file from [Checkstyle GitHub](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml).
4. Name the configuration (e.g., *Google Style*).
5. Click **OK** to save the configuration.

---

## **3. Enable Checkstyle in a Project**
1. Open your project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Navigate to `File > Settings > Tools > Checkstyle`.
3. Under **Scan Scope**, select `Whole project` or `Current file`.
4. Set your preferred configuration as the default by checking the box next to it.
5. Click **OK** to save.

---

## **4. Write a Simple Java Class**
Letâ€™s create a simple Java class and see how Checkstyle enforces coding standards.

### Example Code (`Student.java`):
```java
public class Student {

    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor
    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Getter for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for name
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Setter for age
    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Method to display student info
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
    }
}
````

## **5. Analyze Code with Checkstyle**
Right-click on your project folder or file and select Checkstyle > Scan with Checkstyle.
Checkstyle will analyze your code and display warnings/errors in the Checkstyle Results window.

------------

## **6.Fixing Common Checkstyle Errors**

Example Error **1: Missing Javadoc Comments**
 - Issue: Public classes and methods must have Javadoc comments.
 - Fix: Add Javadoc to your class and methods:
````java

/**
 * Represents a Student with a name and age.
 */
public class Student {
    // ...
}

/**
 * Displays student information.
 */
public void displayInfo() {
    System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
}

````

Example Error **2: Line Length Exceeds Limit**
   - Issue: A line exceeds the configured maximum length (e.g., 100 characters).
   - Fix: Break long lines into multiple lines for better readability:
````java
System.out.println(
    "Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age
);


````
## **7. Run Checkstyle Again**
After making changes, run Checkstyle again to ensure the issues are resolved.

---

## **8. Benefits of Using Checkstyle**
- Enforces coding standards, such as naming conventions and line length.
- Improves code readability and maintainability.
- Identifies potential errors early in development.
