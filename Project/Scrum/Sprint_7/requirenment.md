# Sprint 7 Assignment: Final Project Tasks â€“ Code Review, Code Clean-Up, and Acceptance Testing

## Overview
In Sprint 7, your goal is to finalize your Java-based software engineering project by applying a structured approach to code quality and project readiness. This includes conducting a statistical code review, applying code-cleaning practices, and performing acceptance testing. Completing these tasks will help ensure that your project is not only functional but also maintainable, efficient, and ready for final presentation.

## Objectives
1. **Code Review & Quality Analysis**: Identify and correct code issues by performing a statistical code review.
2. **Code Clean-Up**: Apply code clean-up techniques to enhance code readability, reduce redundancy, and adhere to best practices.
3. **Acceptance Testing**: Conduct an acceptance test based on specified requirements and report your findings.

## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Statistical Code Review
1. **Run Static Code Analysis Tools**: Use tools such as **Checkstyle**, **PMD**, or **FindBugs** (or another instructor-approved static analysis tool) to analyze your codebase for:
   - Code violations and potential errors
   - Areas for optimization
   - Readability and formatting issues

2. **Analyze the Metrics**: Extract and document key metrics such as:
   - Code complexity (e.g., cyclomatic complexity)
   - Lines of code per method
   - Duplicate code
   - Potentially unreachable code blocks

3. **Document Findings**: Summarize the results from your analysis tool, listing any areas of concern and suggested changes. Your report should include:
   - Summary statistics for key metrics
   - Explanations for any significant or high-priority findings
   - Screenshots or code snippets to illustrate specific issues

### Task 2: Code Clean-Up
1. **Refactor Based on Review**: Using the findings from your statistical code review, implement code improvements. Specifically:
   - Refactor any functions with high complexity into smaller, more manageable units.
   - Remove redundant or duplicate code.
   - Simplify variable names and method signatures where applicable.
   - Ensure consistent code formatting (spacing, indentation, etc.).

2. **Check Code Quality Standards**: Ensure that your code adheres to **Java coding standards** and best practices, focusing on:
   - Proper documentation and commenting
   - Efficient and understandable variable names
   - Appropriate use of classes, objects, and inheritance (if applicable)

3. **Verify Code Changes**: Run unit tests to ensure that the code refactoring did not introduce any new bugs or errors.

### Task 3: Acceptance Testing
1. **Define Acceptance Criteria**: Review the original project requirements and any additional specifications you have established with your team or instructor. Use these to create a list of acceptance criteria, which will serve as the benchmark for testing.

2. **Design Acceptance Tests**: Develop a set of acceptance tests (or user acceptance tests) that validate each of the core functionalities and requirements of your project. This can include:
   - Functional tests (testing core features and interactions)
   - Usability tests (ensuring that the user interface is intuitive)
   - Performance tests (verifying response times and efficiency)

3. **Conduct Testing**: Run your acceptance tests, documenting each test and its results in a test report.

4. **Acceptance Test Report**: Write a formal test report that includes:
   - A list of each test performed, including the acceptance criteria it addresses
   - Test results (Pass/Fail) and any relevant screenshots or log outputs
   - A summary of any issues identified and a brief description of how each was resolved

---

## Submission Requirements
- **Code Review Report**: A document with an analysis of the statistical review findings, including code metrics, issues identified, and recommended changes.
- **Codebase**: Submit the final version of your refactored code, ensuring that all unit tests pass.
- **Acceptance Test Report**: A formal report that lists acceptance tests, their results, and any corrective actions taken to address issues identified.

---

## Grading Criteria
Your grade will be based on:
- **Thoroughness of Code Review** (25%): Completeness and depth of the statistical code review and documentation of findings.
- **Code Quality & Cleanliness** (30%): Adherence to Java coding standards, code readability, and effective use of refactoring.
- **Acceptance Testing Completeness** (25%): Coverage of acceptance criteria, clarity of test cases, and accuracy of test results.
- **Final Documentation and Reporting** (20%): Quality, organization, and completeness of submitted reports.

## Deadline
The assignment is due by **[Insert Date Here]**. Please submit all documents and your codebase through the designated submission platform by the deadline.

---

## Tips for Success
- Ensure you thoroughly understand the requirements and acceptance criteria before starting.
- Run the code analysis and code-cleaning steps iteratively to catch as many issues as possible.
- Reach out for support or clarification if you encounter blockers during code review or testing.

## Expected Outcome
By the end of Sprint 7, you should have a high-quality, thoroughly tested project ready for presentation and final evaluation.
